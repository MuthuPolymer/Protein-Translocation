LAMMPS input files for running Protein Translocation simulations
(a)No_Hydro: Only electrostatic interaction between the amino acid and the nanopore beads corresponding to a nanopore surface potential of 1 mV.
(b)Hydro: Electro-osmosis effects are included due to zeta potential of the nanopore surface of 1 mV.
